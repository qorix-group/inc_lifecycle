Lifecyclemanager class
======================

Introduction
------------

Purpose of ``score::mw::lifecycle::LifecycleManager`` component is to have a layer of abstraction, that unifies API, for execution managers.

.. note::

   This component has ``ASIL-B`` safety level.

External C++ interfaces
-----------------------

``LifecycleManager`` class is a decoration of :ref:`score::mw::lifecycle::Application <application_lifecycle>` class. It adds POSIX signal handling for SIGTERM signal, for decorated ``Application``.

Methods which have to be implemented in case of adding new lifecycle manager:

report_running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hook function for reporting running state in lifecycle manager

report_shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hook function for reporting shutdown state in lifecycle manager

POSIX signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIGTERM
^^^^^^^

Lifecycle manager ``handle_signal`` function waits for SIGTERM signal, if signal is received it's shuts down application, reports shutdown to execution manager and exits itself.
