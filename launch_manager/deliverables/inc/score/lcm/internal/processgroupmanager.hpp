/// @brief ProcessGroupManager provides the core functionality of LCM.
/// Software that is deployed to the machine, should be managed through Process Groups.
/// A Process Group (PG) can be described as a set of applications, or executable files, that should be controlled in a coherent way.
/// Through a Process Group, Launch Manager will control the life cycle of Operating System (OS) processes.
/// They will be started and stopped when State Management (SM) request so and they will be started and stopped in a way, that is described by integrator through configuration.
/// When SM request PG change, ProcessGroupManager will use ConfigurationManager to figure out what processes shall be started, or stopped, as well as their startup configuration.
/// Then ProcessGroupManager will use Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) to start, or stop, processes as per configuration.
/// Some of the responsibilities of ProcessGroupManager include:
///     Interaction with ConfigurationManager to ensure that, the list of processes that are running on Machine, is as configured by integrator.
///     Interaction with OSAL to start and stop processes.
///     Interaction with OSAL to discover when processes terminated in an unexpected way.
///     Fulfilling PG State transitions requests from SM, as well as informing SM about unexpected problems (for example process crashes).
