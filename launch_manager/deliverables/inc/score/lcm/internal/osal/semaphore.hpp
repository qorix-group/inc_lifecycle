/// @brief Semaphore class is a wrapper class for POSIX semaphores.
///
/// This class is a wrapper around POSIX semaphores and initialization of the semaphore object ensures correct behavior across different systems.
/// This class supports both local semaphores (shared within a single process) and shared semaphores (shared between processes).
/// Proper initialization and deinitialization methods (`init` and `deinit`) are provided to manage the lifecycle of the semaphore,
/// avoiding issues related to static initializers that might not be portable across different platforms.
///           The following POSIX semaphore functions and behaviors are encapsulated:
///           1) `sem_init` initializes the semaphore with a specified value and optionally sets it as shared between processes.
///             - https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_init.html
///           2) `sem_wait` decrements the semaphore value, blocking if the value is zero until it can be decremented.
///             - https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_wait.html
///           3) `sem_post` increments the semaphore value, potentially waking up blocked threads.
///             - https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_post.html
///           4) `sem_timedwait` attempts to decrement the semaphore, blocking until it can be decremented or the timeout expires.
///             - https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_timedwait.html

    ///          - If `shared` is set to 1, the semaphore can be shared between processes.

    /// @param value The initial value of the semaphore.
    ///        This value determines how many times the semaphore can be decremented (waited on) before blocking.

    ///        until another process or thread posts (increments) the semaphore.

    /// @brief Decrement the semaphore, blocking until the semaphore can be decremented or the timeout expires.

    ///        - `sem_post` returns 0 on success (semaphore incremented).
